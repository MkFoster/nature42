## Expected Structure
As a text-based adventure game, typical organization would include:
- Game logic and engine code
- Story/narrative content
- Player state management
- Command parsing and input handling
- Save/load functionality

## Conventions
- Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful module and function names
- Keep game logic separate from UI/presentation
- Store game data (story, items, locations) in structured format
