# My Kiro Notes
This is a list of tools I used to build the Nature42 text-base adventure game project.

## Vibe Session
* Validated my project idea and got suggestions on how to make the game more interesting to a modern crowd.

## Kiro Powers
* Added the Stands Agent SDK Power - Super easy install. MCP like capabilities but extended to overcome the challenges with adding MCP servers to a coding agent.
