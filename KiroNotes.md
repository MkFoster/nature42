# My Kiro Notes
This is a list of tools I used to build the Nature42 text-base adventure game project.

## Vibe Session
* Validated my project idea and got suggestions on how to make the game more interesting to a modern crowd.

## Kiro Powers
* Added the Stands Agent SDK Power - Super easy install. MCP like capabilities but extended to overcome the challenges with adding MCP servers to a coding agent.

## Challenges
* Constantly needed to remind Kiro to use the Strands Agents power up to get the latest Strands documentation.  Kiro would often write Strands related code without fully understanding it's capabilities.  I.e., it didn't leverage Strand's session management when the requirements clearly called for it.  I had to explicitly tell it to do so once I noticed it didn't have any memory from prompt to prompt.
