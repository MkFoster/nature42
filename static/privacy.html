                <h2>AI/LLM Data Usage</h2>
                <p>Nature42 uses AI language models (via the Strands Agent SDK and Amazon Bedrock) to generate game content including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Location descriptions and narratives</li>
                    <li>NPC dialogue and interactions</li>
                    <li>Puzzle generation and evaluation</li>
                    <li>Location imagery</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your commands and game interactions are sent to these AI services to generate responses. This data is processed in real-time and is not stored permanently by the AI service beyond what is necessary for content generation.</p>
